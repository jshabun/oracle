## 🎯 Core Features Implemented

### 1. Analytics Engine (`backend/app/core/analytics.py`)

**PlayerStats Class:**
- Stores all 9-category stats
- Calculates FG% and FT% from makes/attempts
- Per-game averages

**CategoryAnalyzer:**
- Z-score calculation across all categories
- Special handling for percentage stats (weighted by volume)
- Turnovers inverted (lower is better)
- Punt strategy detection
- Marginal value calculation

**DraftEngine:**
- Draft recommendations based on:
  - Total Z-score (player value)
  - Positional needs
  - Category gaps
  - Snake draft position awareness

### 2. API Structure

```
/api/v1/
├── yahoo/          # Yahoo Fantasy integration
├── players/        # Player search, stats, rankings
├── team/           # Roster, standings, matchups
├── draft/          # Draft mode and recommendations
└── recommendations/ # Pickups, drops, trades, streaming
```

### 3. Frontend Pages

All pages have placeholder UI ready for data integration:
- Dashboard: Quick stats and actions
- Draft Mode: Draft position setup and recommendation display
- Team Management: Roster view and category performance
- Players: Search interface and rankings
- Recommendations: Waiver wire, streaming, trades

## 🔄 Next Steps to Make It Work

### Phase 1: Yahoo API Integration
1. Get Yahoo API credentials (see docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)
2. Implement OAuth flow in `backend/app/services/yahoo.py`
3. Create data fetching functions:
   - League info
   - Player stats
   - Available players
   - Your roster

### Phase 2: Data Pipeline
1. Set up database models (`backend/app/models/`)
2. Create data import scripts
3. Implement player stats updates (daily Celery task)
4. Populate initial player database

### Phase 3: Connect Frontend to Backend
1. Create API client (`frontend/src/services/api.js`)
2. Update pages to fetch real data
3. Add error handling and loading states
4. Implement WebSocket for draft mode

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
1. Test draft recommendations with real data
2. Calibrate Z-score calculations
3. Fine-tune punt strategy detection
4. Add unit tests

### Phase 5: Deployment
1. Copy docker-compose.yml to your Ubuntu server
2. Set environment variables
3. Deploy via Portainer
4. Configure domain/SSL (optional)

## 📊 How the Analytics Work

### Example: Evaluating Nikola Jokić

```python
# Per-game stats
FG%: 58.5% (9.5/16.2)  → Z-score: +2.5
FT%: 82.1% (5.2/6.3)   → Z-score: +1.2
3PM: 0.9               → Z-score: +0.1
PTS: 25.1              → Z-score: +2.8
REB: 11.8              → Z-score: +3.5
AST: 9.0               → Z-score: +3.2
STL: 1.4               → Z-score: +1.1
BLK: 0.9               → Z-score: +0.4
TO: 3.0                → Z-score: -0.5 (inverted)

Total Z-score: 14.3 (Elite tier, #1 overall)
```

### Category-Specific Rankings

The system can rank players by any single category:
- **3PM Leaders**: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Klay Thompson
- **FG% Leaders**: Rudy Gobert, Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela
- **BLK Leaders**: Victor Wembanyama, Brook Lopez, Jaren Jackson Jr.

### Punt Strategy Example

If you draft Giannis early (weak in FT%, 3PM), the system will:
1. Detect you're punting FT% (Z < -0.5)
2. Recommend more centers (ignore their FT%)
3. Focus on FG%, REB, BLK, STL
4. Avoid high-FT% guards who don't excel elsewhere

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up Yahoo API credentials
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your credentials

# 2. Start everything
docker-compose up --build

# 3. Access the app
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## 🎨 UI Preview

The frontend has a clean, modern design:
- **Color scheme**: Orange (#FF6B35) and Blue (#004E89) on white
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Basketball theme**: 🏀 icons and sports-focused UI
- **Category badges**: Visual indicators for 9-cat stats

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Yahoo OAuth tokens are stored securely
- Environment variables for all secrets
- CORS configured for known origins
- Input validation on all endpoints

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Z-score calculations cached (1 hour)
- Player data updated daily
- Database indexed on frequently queried fields
- React Query for client-side caching

## 🐛 Known Limitations (To Do)

- Yahoo API integration not yet implemented (skeleton only)
- Database models need to be created
- Frontend API calls return placeholder data
- No real-time draft updates yet (WebSocket planned)
- Trade analyzer logic simplified

## 💡 Key Insights for Your League

### 9-Category Strategy Tips

1. **FG% & FT% are zero-sum**: Improving one player's % affects team average
2. **TO is negative**: High-assist guards often hurt you here
3. **Positional scarcity**: Elite centers (Jokic, Embiid, AD) are rare
4. **Punt strategies work**: Ignoring 1-2 categories lets you dominate others
5. **Streaming matters**: 5 pickups/week = 20+ games added per month

### Draft Approach

**Early rounds (1-5):**
- Target elite, well-rounded players
- Consider positional scarcity (centers first?)
- Establish your category strengths

**Middle rounds (6-10):**
- Fill positional needs
- Double down on your strengths
- Identify punt candidates

**Late rounds (11+):**
- Target specific categories
- Find breakout candidates
- Secure depth

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Once live, track:
- Draft recommendations accuracy (did they perform well?)
- Waiver wire pickup value
- Trade analysis correctness
- Lineup optimization games gained
- Your league standing! 🏆
