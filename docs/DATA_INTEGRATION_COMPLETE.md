# Data Integration Layer - Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented the data integration layer that connects the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API with our Z-score analytics engine. This enables **real draft recommendations** using actual player statistics from your Yahoo league.

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Data Mapper (`backend/app/services/data_mapper.py`)

**Purpose:** Convert Yahoo API responses to our internal `PlayerStats` format

**Key Components:**
- `YahooDataMapper` class with stat ID mapping
- `parse_player_stats()` - Handles 3 different Yahoo response formats
- `parse_multiple_players()` - Batch processing
- `format_player_for_response()` - API response formatting

**Lines of Code:** 240+

**Features:**
- ✅ Handles nested Yahoo response structures
- ✅ Calculates percentages from makes/attempts
- ✅ Supports multiple Yahoo API endpoints
- ✅ Error handling for missing data

---

### 2. Player Data Service (`backend/app/services/player_data_service.py`)

**Purpose:** High-level service combining Yahoo data fetching with analytics

**Key Methods:**

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `get_available_players_with_stats()` | Fetch free agents with stats | List of PlayerStats |
| `get_draft_recommendations()` | Get ranked draft recommendations | Formatted recommendations with Z-scores |
| `get_player_rankings()` | Overall or category-specific rankings | Ranked player list |
| `search_players()` | Search by name with analysis | Search results with Z-scores |
| `analyze_trade()` | Trade impact analysis | Trade analysis (TODO) |

**Lines of Code:** 340+

**Features:**
- ✅ Batch processing with rate limit handling
- ✅ In-memory caching (6-hour TTL)
- ✅ Integrates DraftEngine for recommendations
- ✅ Position filtering support

---

### 3. Updated Player Endpoints (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/players.py`)

**New Endpoints:**

```
GET /api/v1/players/search
    - Search players by name with stats & rankings
    
GET /api/v1/players/rankings
    - Overall player rankings by total Z-score
    
GET /api/v1/players/rankings/category/{category}
    - Category-specific rankings (PTS, REB, AST, etc.)
    
GET /api/v1/players/available
    - Available players with full Z-score analysis
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Uses PlayerDataService for all data
- ✅ Returns Z-scores for all categories
- ✅ Includes total fantasy value
- ✅ Position filtering support

---

### 4. Updated Draft Endpoints (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/draft.py`)

**New/Updated Endpoints:**

```
POST /api/v1/draft/start
    - Start draft session with league context
    
GET /api/v1/draft/recommendations
    - Get real recommendations using Yahoo data
    
POST /api/v1/draft/pick
    - Record pick and update session state
    
GET /api/v1/draft/board
    - Get current draft board state
    
GET /api/v1/draft/session/{session_id}
    - Get session details
    
DELETE /api/v1/draft/session/{session_id}
    - Delete draft session
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Session tracking with UUID
- ✅ Integrates PlayerDataService
- ✅ Punt strategy detection (TODO: enhance)
- ✅ Roster tracking

---

### 5. Test Suite (`test_data_integration.py`)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing of the data integration layer

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Data Mapper with sample Yahoo response
2. ✅ Yahoo API connection and authentication
3. ✅ Player Data Service methods (all 5)
4. ✅ Analytics engine Z-score calculations

**Lines of Code:** 400+

**Usage:**
```bash
python test_data_integration.py
```

---

### 6. Documentation

**New Documents:**
- `docs/ENDPOINTS_GUIDE.md` - Complete API reference with examples
- Updated `README.md` - Latest features and quick start

**Updated Documents:**
- Added data integration examples
- Included Z-score explanation
- API usage workflows

## 📊 Technical Details

### Data Flow

```
Yahoo API → YahooDataMapper → PlayerStats → CategoryAnalyzer → Z-Scores
                                    ↓
                             PlayerDataService
                                    ↓
                              API Endpoints
                                    ↓
                             Frontend (TODO)
```

### Yahoo Response Handling

The mapper handles **3 different response formats**:

**Format 1:** `player_stats.stats` (array)
```json
{
  "player_stats": {
    "stats": [
      {"stat_id": "5", "value": "520"}  // FGM
    ]
  }
}
```

**Format 2:** `stats` (array)
```json
{
  "stats": [
    {"stat_id": "5", "value": "520"}
  ]
}
```

**Format 3:** Index-based (tuple)
```json
[
  "some_key",
  {"stats": [...]}  // Stats at index [1]
]
```

### Z-Score Calculation

For each category:
```python
z_score = (player_value - league_mean) / league_std_dev
```

**Special Handling:**
- **Percentages (FG%, FT%):** Weighted by volume (attempts)
- **Turnovers:** Inverted (lower is better)
- **Total Value:** Sum of all category Z-scores

### Rate Limit Handling

Yahoo API limits: **10,000 requests/day**

Strategy:
- Batch requests when possible
- 0.5s delay between individual player fetches
- In-memory caching (6-hour TTL)
- Limit default to 100 players
